i’d like to believe that i start every word without pretense.  but the truth is that i’m always writing to you.  it is a one way conversation. from myself to what i claim as signs; from my body to the guide posts of memory; or my feet to the stony bed of a shallow puddle.  i’m in london, and it’s raining again.  i’m sitting in my solitude, in ways which make me feel both full and flimsy.  but i’ve felt this way for long enough now that i know, it is nothing more than the return of a kind of tide — all i ever have to do is float through.

i am thinking of the last time that i was in here; amidst waves of unfolding life i was buoyed by a notion of stability that wasn’t fully real. i know i had fashioned it so sweetly in my mind. it was a tender palace built upon love and hope, in a world that hadn’t seemed so incomprehensibly frightening then.  i’m thinking of the home i thought i could return to.  but where is a body more at home? what is more true, more stable of a state: that gravitational tether to another, acceleration pulling towards? or the uncompromising drift of inertia, the cumulative force and balance of all the space surrounding?

there was a recent morning when i had some arguably embarrassing thoughts and still, i felt a compulsion to share them.  maybe they’re only embarrassing in the sense that no one ever really dares to speak such things aloud, but who knows.  i imagine a chamber within where the spirit and muscle of the power of the erotic draws strength.  it beats, but slowly. it’s cryogenically frozen. <em>a weak sun flickers over the dry surface.</em>  and still, stirred the most innocuous details. how a person, very gently, cradles a spider in broad hands to release it out of the window. then points out a bird of prey flying overhead.

it is a one way conversation, from myself to details. the details convince me to live. every day is a kind of starting over — a new bewildered reckoning with anguish, fury, devastation, tangles of emotion that still escape name.  where does joyful imagination draw its strength? the currents of grief stay blurring together: charred corpses beneath my eyelids, children terrorized out of innocence, reporters rummaging through their ransacked family homes, the bleak absence of sound, the aching blue of distance. and my heart that by now has simply become a collection of shards, sediment deposited helplessly and liberally in the places or people that have touched me.

truth is, i cannot help but keep my eyes open to all that i see. the details convince me to live.  they are flowers sprouting from concrete, or light leaking through photographs.  they are like music, that which opens a portal into freedom and family beyond space and time.  the details remind me of dignity, of transformation that is possible, and the great mistake i so often make of acting as if i were truly alone. how it is always, always, worth it to fight and live for something more. even as i feel the distance widen, or wake up from dreams haunted by all that i miss or grieve — i collect each detail as offering to myself in the future, or to that space to which i am speaking: the veil beyond which i relinquish all claims of knowledge or control. knowing that still, as ever, my words, my actions, my heart, my spirit, my love, has meaning.

and i am thinking of how we are under the same familiar sun, the same blanket of sky.  how our hair keeps on growing out, the moon waxes for us both overhead. and how blue can be ache but blue can also be dusk, streaked with a beauty like orange at sunset, settling into the quiet, needed change of night.
