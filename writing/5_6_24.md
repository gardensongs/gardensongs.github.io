there are so many pictures i wish i could paint for you, thoughts that pass through my mind every day.  it’s the constancy of this impulse that gnaws at me. if only i could capture everything floating by: every speckle of dandelion or flutter of leaves, the windy currents billowing through them. if only i could cradle these for just a moment, preserve them in a jar, so that one day — the day when we can finally sit down together in sweetness and warmth and peaceful still again — i can let it all pour out.  and perhaps time will land in our bodies like it’s actually full, whole and good. it feels foolish to wish for happiness, but my mind can’t help but think in the simplest, or most romantic (or naïve? what’s the difference) terms, and the wish burns in my throat anyhow. perhaps we will be happy, really. perhaps we will be happy and look back on this moment as one in the midst of a long and terrible dream.

i’ve been in berlin for a couple of days.  have you been here? i can’t remember — but i keep thinking about how much you’d love the abundance of trees. and now that it’s spring, and the sunshine outweighs the grey, there’s dappled light spilling over every cobblestone. maybe you have felt this, too: in new york the sky seems somewhat far away, like the thinnest of gauze stretches taut before it.  but here it is as if the tops of buildings press up right against a pure blue surface, large beyond my comprehension. the timbre of light itself is different; it ricochets just that bit more sharply, the difference between drinking a cold glass of water and a lukewarm one.

oh, and i’m writing you while on the train back from rehearsal.  i can’t believe i’m rehearsing here, with a band!! it feels a little dorky to say this, but i’ve had absolutely zero chill about finally being able to realize the music i’m playing in a group setting.  another strangeness of time: five years have passed since my first EP release — so revisiting and re-imagining his music is like returning to another life. but there is so much tenderness nestled within. and it’s freeing to have the space to musically evolve, both i and the songs themselves.  i don’t know how i’m moving right now and making it all happen, to be honest… but i’m proud of myself, and thankful for the opportunities that come.

anyways. this is a short one. i’m only sharing because i miss you. every sentence is just another way of saying it: i miss you, i love you, i wish you could be here. i know you love me too. ♥︎
